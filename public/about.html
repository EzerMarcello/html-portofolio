<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I was born in Bekasi, West Java. Since I was little,
   I really liked playing football until I dreamed of becoming a famous football player, like Messi.
   I also have talent in the IT field, since middle school I have started teaching myself about the mechanics of the 
   world of programming.</p>

<p>I started my junior high school life in a different city, precisely in 
  Denpasar, Bali. I have many friends who are involved in programming too, 
  therefore I am also interested in starting to learn programming.</p>

<p>I have the ambition to become a great programmer, 
  with the skills I have now, I have learned enough from a lot of media, 
  I have also taken programming lessons, I have also taken many online courses.</p>
